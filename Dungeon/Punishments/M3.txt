@Flag(RepeatCornerTime) Well since we're doing it again I better repeat the instructions.. #DT4
Now its very simple slut! #DT4 @TempFlag(RepeatCornerTime)
In a moment you'll go to the corner.. #DT4
While in the corner I want you to be on your toes! #DT4
At no point are you allowed to rest down on your heels #DT4
At least not while standing there #DT4
You'll hear my voice saying "up" or "down" #DT4
Down means going down in a squat still on toes #DT4
Up means standing up on your toes.. #DT4
Now I'm not done #GNMGrin #DT4
I want you to count the number of commands I give in your head #DT4
Everytime you hear a command I want you say "Thank You #DomHonorific " #DT4
Lastly I want you to count everytime your heel strikes the floor or you loose your balance.. #DT4
If both heels strikes at the same time it counts as two! #DT4
I never said this would be easy #GNMLol #DT4 @SetVar[CornerCommandsGiven]=[0]

I'm gonna give you 2 choices since you can't seem to do this right.. #DT4
Either you repeat the punishment or I'll count this punishment as a fail and collect a fee from you.. #DT4 @Timeout(10,FeeSilence)
[repeat,punish,punishment,yes]Again it is then.. #DT4 @Goto(Repeat)
[fail,fee,not again,please no,no,please don't,don't]#GNMGrin #DT4 @Goto(Fee)
